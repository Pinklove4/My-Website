  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and driven Network Engineer with a deep understanding of virtualization, system administration, and modern networking technologies.
       Over the years,I’ve built expertise in platforms such as Hyper-V and Proxmox, leveraging them to design and manage efficient, scalable virtual environments.
       My strong foundation in Linux and Ubuntu allows me to optimize systems for performance, security, and reliability, while ensuring seamless integration across
       diverse infrastructures. Beyond virtualization and operating systems, I bring a comprehensive skill set that covers core networking principles, routing and 
       switching, firewalls, VPNs, and cloud-based solutions. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges, whether it’s architecting resilient networks, automating 
       processes, or troubleshooting mission-critical systems. What inspires me most in this field is the opportunity to connect people, ideas, and technology. I see 
       networking not just as cables and configurations, but as the backbone of innovation—enabling businesses and individuals to achieve more. My goal is to continue
       growing as a professional, sharing knowledge, and building systems that are secure, scalable, and future-ready.</p>

      <h3>My Expertise</h3>
      <p>LAN/WAN Design and Implementation I designed and configured Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs), applying subnetting, routing protocols, and VLANs to create efficient and secure network topologies.

Virtualization with Hyper-V and Proxmox I built and managed virtual environments using Hyper-V and Proxmox, deploying multiple virtual machines to simulate enterprise-level infrastructure and practice resource allocation, failover, and clustering.

Linux and Ubuntu Server Administration I installed and configured Linux-based servers, including Ubuntu, to host services such as DNS, DHCP, FTP, and web servers. This helped me strengthen my skills in command-line administration and system security.

Firewall and Security Configuration I implemented firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) to secure networks, tested intrusion detection/prevention systems, and practiced hardening techniques to protect against common vulnerabilities.

Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting I used tools like Wireshark and Nagios to monitor traffic, analyze packet flows, and troubleshoot connectivity issues, gaining hands-on experience in diagnosing and resolving real-world problems.

VPN and Remote Access Setup I configured Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to enable secure remote access, learning how encryption and tunneling protocols protect data across public networks.

Cloud Integration Projects I experimented with connecting on-premises networks to cloud platforms, simulating hybrid environments that reflect modern enterprise setups.

Capstone Project: Enterprise Network Simulation I collaborated with classmates to design a full-scale enterprise network, including multiple sites, redundant links, and security layers. This project allowed me to apply everything I had learned in a real-world scenario.</p>
