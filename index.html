  <section id="about">
    <h2>Who Am I</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and driven Network Engineer with a deep understanding of virtualization, system administration, and modern networking technologies.
       Over the years,I’ve built expertise in platforms such as Hyper-V and Proxmox, leveraging them to design and manage efficient, scalable virtual environments.
       My strong foundation in Linux and Ubuntu allows me to optimize systems for performance, security, and reliability, while ensuring seamless integration across
       diverse infrastructures. Beyond virtualization and operating systems, I bring a comprehensive skill set that covers core networking principles, routing and 
       switching, firewalls, VPNs, and cloud-based solutions. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges, whether it’s architecting resilient networks, automating 
       processes, or troubleshooting mission-critical systems. What inspires me most in this field is the opportunity to connect people, ideas, and technology. I see 
       networking not just as cables and configurations, but as the backbone of innovation—enabling businesses and individuals to achieve more. My goal is to continue
       growing as a professional, sharing knowledge, and building systems that are secure, scalable, and future-ready.</p>
